# Portfolio

### [This Website](https://greghoernersr.online)

OK, it's not much, just a simple site to showcase myself.

#### Technological Info
- Hosted by GitHub Pages
- Jekyll for Template/Markdown content management

### [FUAME](https://www.fuame.com)

As the longest-standing developer on the project, I've watched this site grow and morph over the years both technically and in intent. From an early home-brew application framework, it was being migrated to [Lithium](https://li3.me/) as I Was brought on, and I'm currently spearheading the effort to move to [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (Unfortunately, though intentions were well, the Lithium framework has not been well maintained, and has fallen by the wayside in both technical ability and upkeep). Now live in limited Beta, the site will soon be opened up to the world.

#### Technological Info
- Hosted on AWS (Utilizing VPC, ELB, EC2, S3, SES, CodeCommit, Code Pipeline, etc.)
- LAMP Stack (Ubuntu, Apache 2.4.x, PHP 7.x, MySQL 5.x)
- Laravel MVC Framework (5.x)
- Bootstrap, jQuery and a handful of requisite plugins.

# Hobbies

## Ham Radio

I'm not sure exactly when I made the decision to jump into Ham Radio, but I definitely dove in head-first. Obtaining the highest level of licensure ([Extra Class](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=3568688)), I decided to give back by also becoming an ARRL Accredited [Volunteer Examiner](http://www.arrl.org/ve-session-counts?state=NY). I've dabbled in HF, VHF/UHF, APRS, Digital Modes, EmComm and look forward to applying the skills I've gained in the future towards other aspects including High Altitude Ballooning and beyond!

## Maker

A life long Maker spirit runs deep within me. From ealy roots in the 80's using Radio Shack Electronics Labs to IOT embedded development using high level languages like Python on the ESP platforms, I love to build things and watch them come to life.

## 3D Printing

Despite being on a short hiatus (lack of equipment), I have spent years experimenting with 3D printing including exotic filaments and dozens of custom designs.

## DIY Everything

If it isn't obvious from previously listed hobbies, I'm an avid DIY-er. This extends well beyond the uber-technical realm, to vehicle repair and maintenance, home remodeling and even ocassionally concocting a unique recipe or two (most involve bacon, breakfast food is the best).
